## Alpha

### Instructions 
  When the game begins, you will see three types of cities. The enemy cities (red) and will try to attack you, the neutral cities (grey) will not attack you, and using your cities (blue), you will be able to send troops to attack the other cities. The population of all of the cities will rise over time until they hit the max population limit. 
  
 To play, you click on one of your cities, drag the slider to choose how many troops you want to send from that city's population, and click on the city you want to sent your troops to. The troops continue to be produced over time at a one per second rate until the city hits the maximum population limit. Your troops will then march out of your city and to the other city. If the destination city is an enemy city or a neutral city, the troops will kill some of the population of the city, but if the destination city is one of your own cities, your troops will add more population to your cities. When you defeat a neutral or enemy city, the city will become one of your own.

You win when you control all of the cities on the map. You lose if all of your cities are taken over, or if your score reaches zero.
